# Simple Cloud Model
is a numerical model of a Cumulus cloud, initially proposed and implemented by Nickerson (1965) [^1]. 

In the course of the Vorwissenschaftliche Arbeit, which is part of the Austrian Matura, Philipp Lechner recreated this model during school year 2023/24. 

A detailed description of the model and the analysis thereof, can be found in the paper "Numerical Weather Prediction".
